You do so by using the variable keyword VAR the following word will then be the variable name this is usually descriptive of the action you want but it can be anything. Once a variable is declared and named you can then assign it value and operations. These variables store data temporarily.

Decisions move your script in a direction based on previous evaluations. Loops are the same sequences performed frequently or in repetition. 

Flow charts are often used in planning these scripts by establishing a condition and calculating if the condition is met or not met. Then a path bifurcates and the process continues until optimal conditions are met. Usually decided by boolean calculations.
