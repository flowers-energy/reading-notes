## API Design Best Practices
  - REST stands for Representational State Transfer .
  - REST API's are designed around resources.
  - An identifier of a resource is a unique designator for that resource. An http to a particular resource is an identifier.
  - The most common http verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
  - URI's should be based on nouns and not verbs. 
  - https://website.com/customer
  - To have a chatty API is an API that has multiple requests to recieve bits of data drawing a larger load from the web server. 
  - GET returns 200 if resource is succesfully found.
  - GET returns 404 if resource is unseccfully found.
  - POST returns 201 for a succesfully created resource.
  - DELETE returns 204 for a succesfully removed resource.
