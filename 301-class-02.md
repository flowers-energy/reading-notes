## React lifecycle
  - Render happens before componentDidMount.
  - Mounting is the very first event in a React lifestyle.
  - Constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount
  - componentDidMount is used to load network requests, initialize the DOM and set up subsrciptions.

## React State Vs Props
  - Initial values or data to define what things will render like is typically passed in props
  - "Props are passed into a component and state is handled inside the component" - 2:10 in the React State Vs Props
  - We re-render  state in our application. Props are immutable and connot be re-written.
  - Things we can store in state are elements that need to be changed or updated by users and re-rendered. Forms are a good example of things that change often.
