One Storage to Store Them All

HTML5 Sets out to create an API storage system that renders third-party pluggins per browser obsolete. 

HTML5 provides 5 megabytes of data per origin, storing named key/value pairs in a browser. This data is not transmitted to a server.

  "Data is stored as strings. If you are storing something other than a string, youâ€™ll need to coerce it yourself when you retrieve it." -THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS

Datatypes include: strings, boolean, intergers, and floats stored as strings.
