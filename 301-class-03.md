## React Docs - lists and keys
  - .map returns a new array populated with mutated data from a callback function.
  - To loop through an array and return each value in JSX, .map an array with the embedded expression in the funtion argument as a one liner. Returning an <li>.
  - Each list item needs a unique key.
  - Keys identify items that are dynamic and change regularly in the application.
## The Spread Operator
  - The spread operator "expands iterable objects into a list of arguments"
  - Spread operators can copy an array, concantentate arrays, use math function, and use arrays as arguments.
  - const arr1 = [1,2,3] 
  const arr2 = [4,5,6]
  const arrComb = [...arr1,...arr2]
  output is [123456]
  - const listOne = ['car', 'boat', 'plane']
  const extraItem = ['train', ...listOne]
  output is [car, boat, plane, train]
  
## How to Pass Functions Between Components
  - First step they use pass functions between components is by creating a function where he wants the state to change. 
  - The increment function locates and identifies a matching key in state and passes it back into an array using .map changing the count for each person selected.
  - You can pass a method from parent to child component by using this.state.
  - A child can invoke a method from a parent component by using this.props.
